# SmallProjects -> Stopwatch

In this small project we have stopwatch, which can be triggered to start by clicking on 'Start' button or by pressing 's' on keyboard.
Other features are pause and reset, where pause, triggered by clicking on 'Pause' button or by pressing 'p' on keyboard, stops time increasing.
While reset depends on if measurment is paused, if it`s paused then reset sets time to 00:00 and start needs to be triggered again, while if measurment
is still running and reset is triggered, then time will just start increasing from 00:00. Same as start and pause, reset can be triggered by clicking on
'Reset' button or by pressing 'r' on keyboard.
